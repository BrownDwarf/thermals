1. Introduction
  - Overview of Kepler spacecraft
  - Expectations for signals
  - Overview of available files
  - Data pre-processing

2. Sampling and fitting
  - Existing sampling
  - Fitting signals with splines
  - Fitting signals with Gaussian Processes
  - Registration of different times

3. Data transformations
  - Self-correlation
  - First derivative
  - Chaotic thermal dependence and Moir√©
  - Thermal expansion and thermal cycling
  - Energy

4. Machine learning
  - Predicting temperature from flux residuals
